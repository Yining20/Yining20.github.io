I am currently a graduate student in the [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. Xiqi Gao and Prof. Wenjin Wang. During August to November 2019, I visited Vodafone chair for Mobile Communication Systems and advised by Dr. Xiaohang Song and Prof. Gerhard Fettweis. I received my Bachelor's degree in the Special Class for the Gifted Young, Southeast University in 2018. 

# Research
My research interests includes the wireless communication and statistical inference. In my undergraduate thesis, I investigated the waveform design , with a focus on fast convolution multicarrier (FCMC) for the 5G systems.  During my graduate reserach, I focused on the ** Bayesian inference based receiver design in the massive machine type communication (mMTC) scenario**.
